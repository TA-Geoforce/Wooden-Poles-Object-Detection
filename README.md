## Abstract

Advancement of computer vision algorithms, remote sensing, and geospatial technologies allow a continuous monitoring, mapping, and analysis of feature events on the earth. The goal of this project is to build machine learning and computer vision models to help automate the process of wooden poles identification in earth-observation imagary. The process is planned to be deployed in a cloud enviroment where it can be used large scale computer clusters.
